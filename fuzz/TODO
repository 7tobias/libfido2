- Use dictionaries. It is unrealistic to expect a fuzzer to come up with
  arbitrary strings such as "packed" or "fido-u2f" on its own;
- Fuzz hid.c, hid_linux.c, hid_openbsd.c, hid_osx.c, and hid_win.c. This can be
  done in a platform-agnostic way;
- Make API usage in fuzz_assert.c, fuzz_cred.c, and fuzz_credman.c
  pseudo-random.
