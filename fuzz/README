This directory contains utility scripts to assist the fuzzing of libfido2. They
are not meant to be used as-is, but rather as a starting point.

To fuzz libfido2:

- export AFL_HARDEN=1
- Pass -DFUZZ=1 -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=afl-clang to cmake and rebuild;
- Use preload-snoop.c with a real device to obtain test vectors;
- Fuzz using preload-fuzz.c to read device data from stdin;
- Use the 'report' script to compile coverage reports.
